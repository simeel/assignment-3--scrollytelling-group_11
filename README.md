# The story of Billy Pore
Contributors: Ola Nikolai Skjeret, Simen Elvhaug

## What the project does
The project presents a scrollytelling story about poverty.

## Why the project is useful
This project aims to raise awarness towards poverty, even in countries where it might seem like less of a problem.

## How users can get started with the project
Users can get started by following the [link to GitHub Pages](https://simeel.github.io/assignment-3--scrollytelling-group_11/), or by downloading, forking or cloning the repository.

## Where users can get help with your project
Go to the repository's "issues" tab and open a new issue if it does not already exist.

## Which technology is used
We have structured our CSS using SASS/SCSS with nesting, as well as using BEM naming to organize our HTML and CSS. We have used JavaScript to implement the Intersection Observer API. Intersection Observer makes it so we can start animations once their scene becomes visible from scrolling through the webpage. It is used on each of the story's 5 scenes.
